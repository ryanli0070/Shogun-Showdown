# Shogun Showdown 
Shogun Showdown is a 1v1 local fighting game inspired by classics like Super Smash Bros..
It was my very first major game project, built out of both curiosity and passion for game development.

This project represents a huge milestone for me â€” not only did I get to design and build a playable game from scratch, but I also deepened my understanding of C# and the MonoGame framework along the way.

While making Shogun Showdown, I explored many core programming concepts:
MonoGame Framework for rendering, input handling, and game loop structure.
Game States to manage menus, gameplay, and transitions.
Functions & Loops for player actions, combat logic, and animations.
Arrays & Data Structures to handle multiple entities and attacks.
Collision & Input Handling for responsive gameplay.

This was my first major project and a true passion project.
It sparked my love for making games and taught me not just programming concepts, but also how to bring an idea from scratch to something playable and fun.

I hope you enjoy trying it out as much as I enjoyed making it!
